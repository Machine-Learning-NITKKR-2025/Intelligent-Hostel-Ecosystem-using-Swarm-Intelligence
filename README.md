# 🐝 Intelligent Hostel Ecosystem using Swarm Intelligence  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project proposes a **decentralized, swarm-intelligent facility management system** for hostels. Instead of relying on centralized servers, IoT devices and student apps collaborate like a **hive mind** to:  
- Reduce energy waste ⚡  
- Predict maintenance needs 🔧  
- Improve student well-being 🌱  
- Ensure privacy via **anonymized and federated learning** 🔒  

Inspired by ants, bees, and birds, the system applies **swarm intelligence** principles to make hostels **scalable, resilient, and industry-ready**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
Traditional hostel management systems are centralized, which leads to:  
- Scalability issues as the system grows  
- High infrastructure and maintenance costs  
- Downtime risk if the central server fails  
- Lack of adaptive energy savings and real-time student comfort optimization  

Our solution is a **self-optimizing, decentralized ecosystem** where IoT devices and student apps act as cooperative agents.

## 📊 Dataset  
We will combine **real-time and historical data**:  
- **IoT sensor data**: energy use, temperature, humidity, occupancy, device health  
- **Student app data**: feedback, comfort ratings, usage patterns (anonymized)  
- **Facility logs**: maintenance records and breakdown history  

Synthetic/simulated datasets will be used initially if real IoT data is unavailable.

## 🛠️ Approach & Techniques  
We will apply a combination of **machine learning + swarm intelligence**:  
- **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL):** decentralized decision-making  
- **Anomaly Detection:** predictive maintenance from device patterns  
- **Federated Learning:** local model training without sharing raw student data  
- **Swarm Optimization Algorithms:** Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for balancing energy usage  

Baseline models (regression, decision trees, clustering) will be used for comparison.

## 📈 Evaluation Plan  
The proof-of-concept will be tested against the following metrics:  
- **Energy Efficiency:** % reduction in wasted energy  
- **Prediction Accuracy:** anomaly detection precision/recall  
- **Resilience:** performance under device/server failure simulations  
- **Student Well-being:** comfort index from anonymized feedback
