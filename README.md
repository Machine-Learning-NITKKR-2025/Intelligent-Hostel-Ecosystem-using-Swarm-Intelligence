# 🏠 Intelligent Hostel Ecosystem using Swarm Intelligence

## 📌 Project Overview
This project proposes the development of an **intelligent hostel ecosystem** where **IoT devices** (sensors, actuators, smart meters) and **student mobile apps** collaborate as a **hive mind** using **swarm intelligence**.  
Instead of relying on a single centralized AI, our system uses **decentralized, self-organizing agents** that collectively optimize hostel operations.  

The ecosystem aims to:
- ⚡ **Optimize energy consumption** (lighting, HVAC, water heating)  
- 🔧 **Predict maintenance needs** (AC, pumps, water heaters, doors, etc.)  
- 🙂 **Enhance student well-being** through anonymized comfort feedback and usage data  
- 🔒 **Ensure privacy & scalability** via decentralized decision-making

## 🎯 Motivation
Hostel facility management in Indian campuses (like NIT Kurukshetra) faces challenges:  
- High energy costs  
- Unpredictable equipment failures  
- Food, water, and electricity wastage  
- Student dissatisfaction with comfort levels  

By applying **swarm intelligence + ML**, we aim to make hostels:  
- More **efficient**  
- More **resilient** (graceful degradation even if the cloud is offline)  
- More **student-friendly**

## 🔬 Problem Definition
- **Input:** IoT sensor data (energy meters, occupancy, vibration, temp/humidity), student app feedback (comfort, schedules).  
- **Output:** Optimized control actions (e.g., dim lights, adjust AC setpoints), anomaly alerts for maintenance, well-being recommendations.  
- **Scope:** A proof-of-concept implementation in one hostel block with simulated or partial real IoT data.

## 📊 Data Sources
- Public smart building datasets (energy use, occupancy).  
- IoT sensor data (energy meters, motion sensors, vibration sensors).  
- Simulated data for hostel scenarios (if real data unavailable).  
- Student mobile app feedback (anonymized surveys, comfort ratings).

## 🛠️ Approach & Methods
- **Swarm Intelligence Algorithms**:  
  - Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)  
  - Gossip protocols for decentralized coordination  
  - Stigmergy-style local signaling for occupancy-driven control
